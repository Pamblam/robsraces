Week 11: Ronnie's Run 5K + 5 Mile Challenge
01/15/2022

First time doing the 5K distance. I was setting up my run tracker when the gun went off and ran straight into a tree, but I still managed to set a new PR for 5k by about half a minute.

On race day I was told that I placed third in my division for both the 5k and 10 ditances, and was awarded medals, but the official race results posted later don't actually reflect that.

Chip time: 26:57
Pace: 8:41
